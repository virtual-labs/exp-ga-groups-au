### About the Experiment 

Determining Groups for Expression Analysis Using Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a method that uses a computational approach to group gene expression data efficiently. Inspired by natural selection, GA helps find the best groupings by improving patterns in the data. This approach reduces errors, enhances accuracy, and is useful in areas like genomics and disease research.
